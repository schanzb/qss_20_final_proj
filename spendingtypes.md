## PAC Direct (pac_direct, DI = 'D')
A traditional PAC collects donations and writes a check directly to a candidate's campaign. The candidate's campaign then spends the money however they want. Because it goes to the campaign, it's subject to hard FEC contribution limits ($5,000/candidate/election). CU did not change this. It's a small, capped, tightly regulated channel — which is why your numbers show only ~$3–5M per cycle.


## Independent Expenditures (pac_independent, DI = 'I')
A Super PAC (post-CU) or traditional PAC spends money on its own — buying TV ads, mailers, digital ads — expressly advocating for or against a candidate. The money never touches the campaign. Because there's no coordination with the candidate, the Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United that limits on this spending violate the First Amendment. Post-CU: unlimited. This is the channel that exploded from $330M (2008) to $890M (2012).


## 527 Spending
527s are named after the IRS tax code section that governs them. They were the pre-CU workaround for unlimited outside spending. They could raise and spend unlimited money but were restricted to "issue advocacy" — they weren't supposed to explicitly say "vote for X." In practice the line was blurry. After CU created Super PACs (which can explicitly say "vote for X"), 527s declined as a vehicle. Your data shows this substitution clearly: 527 spending fell from $311M (2008) to $179M (2012) as IE spending tripled.

## Summary
The key relationship: 527s → IEs is a substitution story, not new money entering politics. That's why the outside_ratio in Q1 was relatively stable across all four cycles — the total outside spending footprint didn't change as dramatically as the IE numbers alone suggest. What changed was the legal form and the explicit partisan direction of that spending.
